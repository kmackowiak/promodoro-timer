The PROmodoro is a improved pomodoro application to time management. The technique uses a timer to break down work into 25 minutes intervals, separated by 5 minutes breaks. The difference between PROmodoro and classic pomodoro is combining intervals in 2 hour blocks, and visible on the daily timeline. For one 2-hour block consists of 4 work periods and 3 short breaks. After them follows a long 30 minute break separating another 2-hour block.
